TODO:

serialosc.py:

check for closed ports, allow re-plug

device:
randomize osc server port
finish serial protocol and osc handlers


general theory of operation:
===============================
startup/init

1. read device list/folder

main loop

1. check for serial device, if found:
	- try to open it, if ok:
	- check session file for previous settings, if found:
		resume settings, if not, create file
	- self-assign bonjour port, name "serialosc/m64-0000", regtype _osc._udp
	- start service
	
2. check if any devices closed, if so:
	- cleanup, unregister service
	
3. refresh devices
	- check for incoming/received OSC messages
		- process /sys/ messages
		- process device-specific messages, send serial
	- check for incoming/received serial data
		- process and send OSC

// rename /sys to /serialosc ?
// ability to rename device? default to serial number?
